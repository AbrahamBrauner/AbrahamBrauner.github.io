<h1 style="text-align:center;">UCSD-Hyundai Robotaxi Project</h1>
<br>
<font size="+2">

<p>From October 2018 to January 2019, I worked with the UCSD Design Lab in
  collaboration with Hyundai Motors to design in-transit activities
  for autonomous cars.</p>
<p>It was a huge project, involving over thirty students and staff, and I was
  involved in every step of the design process. This included some work in
  large groups, some work in small groups, and some things where I operated
  autonomously. </p>
<p>Here are some samples of things I worked on:</p>
<br>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Data Collection and Synthesis</h4>
<img src="design_phone.jpg" style="margin:10px 0200px">
<p>This is an example of some data synthesis. I helped consolodate footage,
  primarily taken on the metro, of what people do in-transit. I also helped
  collect observations in airports, Uber rides, and of people arriving on
  campus. We chose to conduct the majority of observations in places other
  than pritively owned cars, becuase we wanted to design for the activities
  you could do in autonomous cars of the future; things that people are not
  currently able to do.</p>

<p>Above is a photo I took while observing people waiting in the airport. There
  are a lot of interesting things to notice here when considering possible design
  implications of this observation. First, see how the father and daughter are
  both using mobile technology. As you can see in the first image, this is
  something that is very common. A good autonomous vehicle (AV) design should
  take this into account.
  Second, notice how one kid is in the father's lap. While this might not be
  ideal for AV's for safety reasons, it is certainly worth noting that this is
  something people would like to have. As well, the daughter is trying to show
  her screen to the father. An AV should probably have a seating arrangement
  that supports this activity sharing.</p>
