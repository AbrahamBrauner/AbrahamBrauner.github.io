Smartphones have revolutionized life in the past decade. A single black rectangular prism can hold your telephone, money, map, music, notes, emails, entertainment, and much more. At the touch of a button, you can communicate with anyone who has a smartphone (basically anyone at all), or get the answer to any question Google knows the answer to (basically any question). Is this the epitome of personal technology?</p><p>Perhaps not. What if we could take that magical black box we keep in our pockets, squeeze it down to a fraction of its former size, stick it in our skulls, and connect it to our neurons? The possibilities such a technology could bring seem limitless. After all, activity in our brains is just a bunch of electrical activity. With this brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, you could close your eyes and watch a movie directly in your visual cortex, without having to squint at a tiny screen. You could send and receive texts just by willing it, instead of tapping at a frustratingly unresponsive miniature keyboard. </p><p>People use the term BCI to mean a variety of things, but I&rsquo;m going to use it to refer to any digital device with two-way connections to your neurons. This means it can take input directly from your brain, and it can directly influence your brain. </p><p>Much of the technology for this sort of brain chip currently exists or is being created. Already there are capabilities of people to move mechanical arms, communicate words telepathically (with a low success rate), and play simple video games like Space Invaders. As well, much of big tech and academia are spending time and resources on developing better receptors and interfaces for neural implants.  </p><p>By all accounts, BCI are coming, and they are coming soon. Given this, we need to be asking ourselves how this technology will impact society. It has the potential to be as transformative as innovations like television, the internet, or smartphones, but unlike these technologies, we can see BCI coming before they are on the market. Is this development the next step in the evolution of our species, or will it end humanity as we know it?

<p style="text-align:center;"><b> Arguments for pursuing BCI</b></p>

<p>Of smartphones, you could say &ldquo;the world is at your fingertips,&rdquo; but with BCI, the world is inside you. Research into better BCI should be pursued because it will help people at an individual level, and as a species.  </p><p>Almost any task we do in our daily lives would be improved by BCI. Instead of typing or dictating texts, emails, notes, and papers, we could just <i>think</i> the words. This would be faster and more fluid than the current system, and far more convenient. Other basic tasks like scheduling would be hugely improved. As it is, if your friend texts you asking to hang out Friday at lunch, you have to go to your calendar, locate the appropriate Friday, and check if it is full, while also keeping in mind any commitments you may have neglected to record. With the calendar in your head, you could just think <i>do I have anything going on Friday at lunch</i>? and an answer would arise. In fact, your availability could appear before you even asked. </p><p>Imagine you are scheduled to meet someone in a new location. Currently, your best option is to use a map app on your phone to help you get nearby, and then try and figure out the area the best you can on foot. Recently I spent 40 minutes on foot searching for a place that Google maps had given confusing directions to. With a BCI, the directions for driving could appear as highlighted segments of road in front of you. The map would be synced to reality, so instead of looking between your phone and the road, augmented reality projected to your visual system would highlight the correct way. When you arrive and begin walking, a similar highlighting could show which walkways to take. Just pick the path that glows. </p><p>The BCI could also record everything that happens to you. Everything you see, everything you hear, would all be stored on its database. Forgot what time you agreed to meet your friend? Not a problem. Your mother says you promised to visit three times a week? Just play back the memory showing it was only twice.  </p><p>Beyond just giving and receiving information, a BCI could help you by altering your very neurochemistry. If you are anxious and unable to sleep, the computer can calm you by releasing or inhibiting neurotransmitters. It can even put you to sleep immediately. If you are angry or sad, the BCI can help reduce the strength of the emotions. Of course, this would be an option; if you didn&rsquo;t want your emotions altered you could skip it. But even emotional purists could benefit from advanced diagnostics on neural conditions. For example, you could know your exact stress level, and compare it to stress levels in other situations. You could even share your stress level to other people and compare it to theirs. </p><p>With sharing like this, BCI would improve our connectedness and empathy as a species. Already there is research in which rats thousands of miles apart were given each other&rsquo;s neural signals, sort of sharing their brains. BCI technology could allow this to a much greater extent. Not only could you share memories and stress levels, but you could share <i>what it is to be you</i>--your very neural mindset. If you are arguing with someone and can&rsquo;t seem to find common ground, you can spend some time in each other&rsquo;s neural states. This would promote compassion and togetherness to an unprecedented extent. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Arguments against pursuing BCI</b></p>

<p>BCI technology is dangerous and will pose serious problems to our society as a whole if its development is not curtailed. Some of the issues are nefarious hackers, totalitarian government, and morality of individualism. </p><p>There are plenty of legitimate concerns about the security of BCI. What if people can convince you to give them money, and remove your memory of it? As technology gets more advanced, its potential for exploitation grows. If you hide your cash under your mattress, a thief must sneak into your house and find it. But if you have an online bank account, it is vulnerable to hacking.  </p><p>Horses don&rsquo;t care about electronic interference, nor do old fashioned mechanical automobiles. But if you have a newer car with an advanced digital system controlling your speed, radio, and temperature, you are vulnerable to be hacked on the highway. What happens when everything about you is digitized in your head? </p><p>All your preferences, activities, and thoughts could constantly be monitored and recorded. If a corporation gains access to them, they could create ads that are so personalized you can&rsquo;t help but fall for them. Or they could go a step further and hack you, reprogramming your brain to <i>want</i> their product. If terrorists wanted to, they could shut down everyone&rsquo;s minds, or make them do terrible things. Political factions could make people want to vote for their candidates, and they would think they wanted this of their own volition. You think Russia hacking our elections is bad now, imagine if the propaganda went directly to our heads. </p><p>Perhaps even fugitives could upload their personalities, thoughts, memories, and emotions into unsuspecting innocents, taking over their brains. Already our society is so reliant on technology that a large-scale hack could be devastating--let&rsquo;s not make it worse by digitizing the entireties of our identities. </p><p>What if employers would only hire you if you showed them your neural history--all your memories, thoughts, impulses? This level of invasiveness and thought policing could be terrible for many. </p><p>A similar but distinct concern is what a government could do to a people who all had BCI. Would people be required to get some level of neural augmentation? At what age could kids get their first implants? Could you even function in society without BCI? </p><p>Since every BCI will have a GPS component for navigation, a government could keep track of all its citizens, and monitor their activities. Questionable as it may be for the NSA to monitor our conversations, consider how much worse would it be if they could read our thoughts. No, stop! Don&rsquo;t think about it--they will put you on a list! </p><p>If there is a war, a government could control people&rsquo;s BCI to not only garner support, but to make them enlist and fight. This level of surveillance and control is something that should be avoided at all costs. </p><p>Of course there would be firewalls and protections to access, but when we are talking about your very mind what level of security is enough? Merely cutting off BCI from communication with things outside your skull would not suffice--cars and billboards don&rsquo;t connect to the internet, and they can still be hacked. Because many of the benefits of BCI are based on their communication to online sources and to other BCI, they will be very vulnerable to many kinds of attacks. The reality is that no firewall is impenetrable, and attaching brains to hackable technology is a very unreasonable risk. </p><p>But even if firewalls were somehow perfect, if there was no risk of hacking and BCI performed only as designed, it would still have a negative impact on society. This is because it could lead to a level of certainty and awareness that would detract from what it is to be human. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a step back and think about the past 20 years. It used to be that if you had a disagreement with someone about some sort of fact you would each present your arguments and reasoning. Now, you can just Google the answer. Although in some ways this is really positive and convenient, it also detracts from an important part of conversation. It is likely that people are become worse thinkers because they have all the answers in their pockets. </p><p>Now let&rsquo;s take this a step further. With BCI, any disagreement you have with others could be resolved by becoming them neurally. All information is only a thought away. The real question becomes, with this kind of system, what actual thinking is even necessary? With so much knowledge and emotion sharing, everyone could become homogenous robots. </p><p>Even if it doesn&rsquo;t go this far, there are situations where too much sharing can be a bad thing. Already plenty of people turn off read receipts when texting (the little things that show the other person if you have read their messages). This is because they don&rsquo;t always want the other person to know that they have seen the message, and allows them more time to formulate a response, or the ability to ignore an awkward topic. When you have the ability to become another person by experiencing everything they experience, it can compromise some of the necessary vagueness in your relationship.  </p><p>Because BCI would cause more problems than it would solve, and because of the dangers it presents to society, research into BCI should be stopped except for purely medical applications.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b> Conclusion: How to pursue BCI</b></p>

<p>Considering the powerful arguments for and against BCI research, I believe the positive possibilities are too tempting to not seek. However, research should be framed by caution, and active awareness of the potential harm. More importantly, anyone getting BCI in their heads must be made aware of the possible harm that could be done.   </p><p>These technologies I have been referring to as BCI are not all going to arise at once. They will be developed slowly, one by one, and this gives us as a society an opportunity to find what we like and what we don&rsquo;t. The issue here is that as people get hardware implanted in their heads, preventing new updates will be much more difficult. It&rsquo;s like getting a computer and then later downloading something nasty--the download can&rsquo;t be prevented once the computer is already sold. One way around this could be to only allow BCI to download approved content from an app store. Because the technology inside people&rsquo;s heads, it&rsquo;s unlikely they would be able to jailbreak it by manipulating hardware.  </p><p>The main takeaway here is that, yes, BCI technology should be pursued because of the amazing capabilities it could bring, but it must be pursued with patience, caution, and care to avoid a dystopian future. </p>
