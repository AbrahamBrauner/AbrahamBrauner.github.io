<font size="+2">
<p>The Challenger Web App is a platform to support user-generated challenges
to make the experience of playing video games more personalized and dynamic.
I created Challenger along with two other students in a cognitive science class at UC San Diego.<p>

<p>I was involved in every step of the project, from needfinding and prototyping to coding and user testing. </p>
<p>Below is a video I created that explains the process. </p>
